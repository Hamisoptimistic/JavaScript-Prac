1. Create a simple adhoc network. (Omnet)
  1. Omnetpp in cmd
  2. go to Inet/examples/adhoc/idealwireless/.ned and Omnetpp
  3. Click Run
  4. increase Host > File/setup configuration/select last and Enter no. of Host

2. Routing table Analysis (Cisco Packet Tracer)
  1. 

3. MAC protocol simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)
  1.Place router from (Wireless Device) and Number of Host.
  2.Check Which Device is getting connected.
  3.Now turn off the non connected device, Remove the Lid and replace with PT-LAPTOP-NM-1W
  4. Turn on and do Mac filtering by enalbling and putting :

4.Create Mobile network (Cisco Packet Tracer)
  1. 1 cell tower , 1 phone, WRT300N,HUBPT-HUB1, CENTRAL-OFFICE-SERVER, 1941 ROUTER5, SERVER PT- SERVER1
  2. ping 10.0.0.1

5.MANET implementation ((Omnet))
  1. omnetpp in cmd
  2. Inet/examples/manetrouting/dymo/dymonetwork.ned and omnetpp
  3. omnetppi.ini/parameters/ ADD-MobilitySpeed = 400mps
  4. Run the simulation

6.Mobile Adhoc using directional antennas (Omnet)
  1.omnetpp in cmd
  2. Inet/showcases/wireless/directionalantennas
  3. Run .ned and .ini and go to Parameters.
  4.RUN with Axially Symmetric Antennas

7. Implement Wireless network simulation (Cisco)
